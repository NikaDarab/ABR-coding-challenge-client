#ABR Coding Activity#
##Summary
The American Board of Radiology is considering building a new headquarters. We love to eat healthy, and we love to eat fresh fish, so we’d like to build in an area where the fish are low in calories and fat. Your assignment is to build an app that will help us determine the best region for our new headquarters.

##API
Our API server is at https://github.com/theabr-org/coding-challenge-server. Please follow the instructions for “Local Usage” to get it running on your machine. It will supply the data you need for this challenge.

##Data
Please review the data returned from that API. It contains various descriptive text fields, nutritional data, links to images, and regional data found in the key NOAAFisheriesRegion.

##Requirements
-The app will fetch data from the coding challenge server.
-The app will have a nav bar with links to each page of the site.
-There is a home page with a list of each NOAAFisheriesRegion from the data set, each showing the average calories and fat per serving for the fish in that region.
-There is a page for each of the regions, showing:
    .The name of the region.
    .The average calories and fat per serving for the fish in that region.
    .A list of fish from that region with:
    .The name of the fish
    .An image
    .Calories / fat per serving
    .Some descriptive text
- A JavaScript front-end framework must be used (Aurelia, React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
-Please do not use a front-end component library for templating (Material UI, Bootstrap, Chakra, Bulma, etc.). We’d like to see how you work with plain HTML and CSS.
-Please take no more than 4 hours to complete this assignment.
##This will be judged on:
-Functionality.
-Code is “clean” and maintainable.
-Markup is well-organized.
-Stretch goal: It looks nice.
##Deliverable
In an email, send the link to a public repository on GitHub (or something similar) that has your solution.
