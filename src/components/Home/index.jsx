        Welcome to our app! The American Board of Radiology is considering
        building a new headquarters, and we want to ensure that it's located in
        an area where fresh, healthy fish are readily available. With our app,
        you can easily explore different regions and discover the average
        calorie and fat content of the fish caught there. By using this
        information, you can help us determine the best location for our new
        headquarters. So, let's get started and find the perfect spot for the
        American Board of Radiology's new home!
